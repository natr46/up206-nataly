## The Impact of Social Vulnerability on COVID-19 in the U.S.: An Analysis of Spatially Varying Relationships


The study accessed the association between COVID-19 case counts and social vulnerability across the US. In order to achieve this, the study used data from the [CDC's Social Vulnerability Index(SVI)](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/index.html) and shapefiles for COVID-19 case count data (up to May 12, 2020). The SVI contained 15 variables that fit into four different themes: SES, household composition and disability, minority status and language, and finally, housing and transportation. Researchers utilized an ordinary least square regression model to understand the relationship between COVID-19 cases and social vulnerability at the global and local scale. Across the 48 states included in the analysis, the overall SVI, and minority status and language were associated with increased COVID-19 cases. Across local geographies, there was variance in the variables associated with increase case counts, including minority status and language, household composition and transportation, and housing and disability. The researchers created three different maps to illustrate the coefficients for the association between COVID-19 case counts and minority status and language, housing and transportation, household composition, and disability. The findings demonstrate the importance of addressing social inequities related to social determinants of health in order to prevent the uneven burden that socially vulnerable communities face during disasters and emergencies. Additionally, the results showcase different social vulnerabilities associated with increase case count depending on the county illustrates how vulnerability during disasters is nonuniform.  

The maps used to illustrate the study results allow for easy identification of the areas with a higher association between the social vulnerability measures and COVID-19 cases. However, across all three maps, counties within California have a medium to a low association with these social vulnerability metrics. The data used for this study only included cases up to May 12, 2020. It would be very informative to explore whether there are changes in the association between social vulnerabilities and case counts with more recent COVID-19. Yet, the low levels of associations in California counties might have resulted from the study's geography level. Many counties in California, including LA, have a lot of variation.  Therefore, by looking at county-level data, the study might be obscuring the association between neighborhood-level social vulnerability measures and COVID-19 Cases.  For me, this highlights the importance of increasing data availability at a more local level. California is yet to release data at the zip code or census tract level for the whole state. When creating place-based policies, it is vital to analyze data at the correct geography. If not, places with high need might not receive the resources they need.
