### Nataly Rios

I am a first-year Urban Planning student at UCLA, completing my Master's degree. I am focused on Transportation Planning and Design and Development. I am currently learning how to use python to conduct spatial analysis through the _**UP206A: Introduction to GIS and Spatial Analysis**_ course. The UP206 course focuses on exploring the foundations of spatial data science. Throughout the quarter, we will learn how to acquire, analyze, model, and visually communication urban data through python and geospatial processing.  

To learn these skills, I will work on a team to address a contemporary urban problem using "real" data and data science. While my project topic hasn't been finalized, here are a couple of my ideas:

1. Access different vulnerability metrics used to measure community level vulnerability in order to understand which one is best at identifying neighborhoods hit hardest by COVID-19

1. Analyze mobility data in order to identify challenges in mobility for older adults, people with disabilities, and Black and Latinx individuals living in Los Angeles as they access education opportunities, healthcare, and jobs

1. Exploring the effects of TOC communities on housing availability, public transportation use, and displacement

Throughout the course, I hope to improve my data analysis skills, learn python for spatial analysis purposes, and enhance my data visualization skills. I'm so excited about this course and can't wait to learn alongside all of you!
