# Week 3: Readign Assigment
For this week's reading, I watched [Boeing's video from when he came to speak to the 206 class last quarter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjp4mxvpoBo&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=InstituteforDigitalResearchandEducation) and read the [Isochrone Mapping Article](https://ucla.box.com/shared/static/ptu0m4ghva9rhglma8mr3enux06hdp5i.pdf).

In terms of the video, it was great to learn about the OSMnx python tool to make it simpler to analyze open street data. I also really appreciated Professor Boeing's point on the importance of making data science more accessible to everyone. Many of today's top Urban Planning programs focus on teaching future planners how to conduct data analysis utilizing python and data science methodology. However, working towards making this type of analysis more accessible to everyone is very important. What if people could easily construct Isochrone's Maps? What if understanding how Isochrone's Maps can create a sense of trust among people to more readily share their travel data through their cell phones? What if communities could then conduct their research to decide where they need bus lanes or bike lanes? The world of open data science and making research more accessible for everyone can potentially be a tool for democratizing policy making and resource distribution. I am not sure how likely it is that we will get to that future. Still, I am hopeful that providing a higher level of access to data analysis and research will help make equal the playing field and not just be a tool to protect the assets of the rich (i.e. redlining, and some modern-day tech real state start-up companies).

For the reading, it was cool to see the type of research the authors were able to conduct using data science. Amazingly, they were able to show how inefficient public transportation if you are traveling beyond 20 min in LA, or how biking can be more efficient than public transportation for people traveling less than 20 minutes. This type of analysis showcases the public transportation system's failures and highlights how to identify areas that could benefit from the investment. I am taking a class on Transportation and Land Use, these past couple of weeks, we have been learning about why the public transportation system declined after the 1920s. Many of the conversations on this failure focus on the fact that public transportation was not profitable or could even pay for it's operating cost. Even later decades, once transportation companies were purchased by the gov't and received subsidies, they were still and still are not very popular in many places. While some of the argument's in the class focus on the systems' failures to pay for themselves due to regulation, I think new analysis techniques such as these can showcase how inefficient public transportation currently is compared to car transit over a longer distance.  Potential routes to close the service gaps between the two modes to encourage more people towards more environmentally friendly forms of transportation that meet their needs. 

To note, I appreciated how the authors point out the limitations with their data sources-- including the unreliability of the walking and biking data and the incongruencies between two of their data sources.
