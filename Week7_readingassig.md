# Reading Assigment - Week 7

### Response to "Parking search caused congestion: Whereâ€™s all the fuss?"

Although my concentration is in TPP, I knew very little about parking coming into the quarter. However, in one of the classes, I am taking this quarter, we learn how cities overbuild parking. It was refreshing to read this article discussing just how much we overestimate the need for parking. 
The article discusses how in 2006, a paper written by UCLA's very own professor, Dr. Shoup, presets data claiming that 30% of driving are trips where people are "cruising,"
or in other words, looking for parking. The "Parking Search ...", challenges this claim by proposing a more rigorous approach to how "cruising" is defined and the data utilized to examine this phenomenon. By providing a more specific definition to "cruising," the authors focus on the externality of extra driving beyond the shortest path to the desired destination instead of whether or not the driver was looking for parking. That means that if a driver starts searching and finds parking before reaching a certain distance from the desired destination, this would not be considered cruising. I appreciate this definition since it highlights how searching for parking doesn't always add to traffic
or pollution. The authors were able to use this definition and test it out thanks to GPS technology. They were able to look at the shortest distance from the origin to the desire destination and then measure how much extra driving was needed to find parking. Using a refined definition of cruising and new GPS data, the authors found that only
about 5-6% of SF and Ann Arbor, Michigan's trips were cruising trips. This is incredible since it highlights how cruising is a much smaller problem than previously established 
(at least in the cities studied). Therefore, policymakers should focus their attention elsewhere instead of focusing on creating more parking. 

#### Questions

In the paper "Parking Search Caused Congestion: Where's all the Fuss?" the definition of the behavior that the study observed, "cruising", is exceptionally well thought out.
What are the steps needed to achieve this level of rigor in developing researching questions? What are ways to search for datasets that could help answer your desire question?
How much does the data available ended up framing the question you can ask, and how can you separate between the data available and your desire question, so you don't end up producing
work that mislead the field (i.e., 30% cruising paper)?
